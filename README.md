# Wine-Quality-Prediction

Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations and Data Analysis.

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10.The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

1.Fixed acidity

2.Volatile acidity

3.Citric acid

4.Residual sugar

5.Chlorides

6.Free sulfur dioxide

7.Total sulfur dioxide

8.Density

9.pH

10.Sulfates

11.Alcohol

12.Quality

# The objective of this project is as follows:

To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy.
